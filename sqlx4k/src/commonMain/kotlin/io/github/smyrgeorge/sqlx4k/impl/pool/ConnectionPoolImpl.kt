/**
 * Represents an implementation of a connection pool that manages a pool of connections and provides
 * methods to acquire and release connections efficiently while maintaining a minimum and maximum
 * number of connections based on the specified configurations.
 *
 * This implementation supports features such as:
 * - Setting a maximum and optionally a minimum number of connections.
 * - Automatic warmup to pre-establish connections up to the minimum count.
 * - Connection expiration detection and cleanup.
 * - Timeout handling during connection acquisition.
 * - Graceful shutdown to clean up resources when the pool is closed.
 *
 * @constructor Initializes the connection pool with the provided options, logger, and connection
 * factory.
 *
 * @param options Configuration options for the connection pool such as max and min connections.
 * @param log Optional logger to record connection pool activities and errors.
 * @param connectionFactory Factory function to create new connections on demand.
